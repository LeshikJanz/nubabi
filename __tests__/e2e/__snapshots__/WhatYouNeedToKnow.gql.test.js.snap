We have 1 billion brain cells at birth and by the age of 3, a thousand billion connections have been created. The relationship between parent and child is crucial to brain development, and it is up to you to provide the sensory input to literally grow Agatha's brain.

As early as day 1, Agatha can see round shapes, red colours, contrasts of light and dark, and can hear and will respond to loud noises. He will pick up your energy and you can transmit calmness and confidence through the way you handle and interact with him. It is never too early to talk and sing to him and to promote bonding through caress and close physical contact.

Babies learn to look with both eyes together in a parallel fashion after birth so if you notice that Agatha is squinting intermittently, don’t be concerned as this is quite normal. He may also be a little jaundiced and this may persist for several weeks but should not get progressively worse. It is usually a good idea to re-weigh Agatha at about 1 week of age. His birth weight should be regained by 7 to 10 days.",

You will learn what makes him alert and what makes him calm and when he is ready for stimulation. Allow yourself and your baby time to learn about each other. The key is to observe his behaviour on an on-going basis, especially in new situations. Look out for signs of enjoyment and signs of sensory overload, so that you can intervene and help him before he gets overwhelmed.

As your baby grows into toddlerhood, you can continue to strengthen your special bond. Daily attentive play ensures that you are nurturing his early learning potential while also building and strengthening your relationship. Whatever stage he is in, dedicate at least 5 minutes of your focussed attention every day, which is uninterrupted. Get rid of all distractions (TV, radio, computer etc), get down to eye level and just play! ",

He will need to grow and develop his complex cortex to damp down these movements which will happen over the coming weeks. His main activity at this stage is sucking and chewing on his hands. Soothing touch and loving contact are vital for Agatha so be calm and make reassuring, slow and confident movements with him.

Agatha's eyes will frequently drift off from parallel gaze and he may squint intermittently until around 4 months Don’t let this stop you gazing lovingly into his eyes keeping your head about 25 cm’s from his. He will love the start of this special communication between the two of you.",

Nobody knows the cause but it is thought to be related to an immaturity in the brain centre responsible for breathing and waking.

SIDS occurs usually during sleep and is most commonly in the 2nd month. 90% will occur before 6 months.

Factors which increase risk are:
* Males (60%)
* Premature birth (< 37/52)
* Low birth weight (< 2.5kg)

Prevention:
* Babies must sleep on their backs, not on their sides (healthy babies do not choke)
* Put baby in a cot in the room with you to start but do not share a bed
* Don’t smoke during pregnancy nor around your baby after birth
* Make sure baby is not too hot. Ideal room temperature is 16-20ºC. No hot water bottles or electric blankets
* Remove baby's hat once inside
* Avoid waterbeds, beanbags, baby nests, fleeced and other soft surfaces as they are not suitable to sleep on
* Use a mattress with a waterproof cover and single over-sheet
* Avoid duvets, quilts, bedding rolls or pillows
* Take your baby for regular checkups and keep up to date with immunisations
* Dummies or pacifiers. There is some evidence that using a dummy reduces incidence of cot death",

Talking, singing and music will give Agatha auditory experiences and it’s never too early to start reading! Try to find picture books that have high contrast patterns and pictures with strong line drawings to show to Agatha in the coming weeks.

When Agatha is asleep, the recommended position is on his back. While awake, however, some lying on his tummy is important. Agatha may even be able to lift his head briefly and turn from side to side. Calm and reassuring touch and loving contact are vital as babies pick up agitation from us.

Pelvic floor exercises are vital to restoring strength and tone to the area and can be done simply while feeding. These exercises will help the perineum and vagina to heal more quickly, to prevent accidental urinary leaks and reduce swelling and bruising of the perineum.

When this spreads to other areas, it is called seborrhoeic dermatitis.  Rub baby oil or olive oil on the scalp to soften and loosen the scales and then shampoo once a week with a tar shampoo as would be used for adult dandruff – keep free of the eyes!

There is often a redness and angry appearance to the skin reflecting secondary infection and an antibacterial cream is often useful.

New hair begins to grow very soon and it may have a completely different texture and colour.  Other conditions that cause hair loss are very uncommon in children under 12 months of age.",

Recent vaccine technology has refined the number of foreign particles in the vaccine to only the vital immunising ones and there are no additives containing mercury in any of the standard vaccines. In fact, the first breath that your baby takes at birth contains more antigenic particles that the entire 1st set of vaccines. There is also NO association between whooping cough vaccines and epilepsy or febrile seizures and whooping cough vaccines can be given routinely. There is no need or advantage in separating vaccines as combined vaccines are completely safe.",
