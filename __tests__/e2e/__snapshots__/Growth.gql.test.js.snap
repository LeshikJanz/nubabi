We have 1 billion brain cells at birth and by the age of 3, a thousand billion connections have been created. The relationship between parent and child is crucial to brain development, and it is up to you to provide the sensory input to literally grow Agatha's brain.

As early as day 1, Agatha can see round shapes, red colours, contrasts of light and dark, and can hear and will respond to loud noises. He will pick up your energy and you can transmit calmness and confidence through the way you handle and interact with him. It is never too early to talk and sing to him and to promote bonding through caress and close physical contact.

Babies learn to look with both eyes together in a parallel fashion after birth so if you notice that Agatha is squinting intermittently, don’t be concerned as this is quite normal. He may also be a little jaundiced and this may persist for several weeks but should not get progressively worse. It is usually a good idea to re-weigh Agatha at about 1 week of age. His birth weight should be regained by 7 to 10 days.",

Congratulations on the birth of Agatha and the start of your amazing journey together.

Newborn babies move in a jerky and uncoordinated way and you may notice Agatha displaying frequent motor tics. This is normal. He will need to grow and develop his complex cortex to damp down these movements which will happen over the coming weeks. His main activity at this stage is sucking and chewing on his hands. Soothing touch and loving contact are vital for Agatha so be calm and make reassuring, slow and confident movements with him.

Agatha's eyes will frequently drift off from parallel gaze and he may squint intermittently until around 4 months Don’t let this stop you gazing lovingly into his eyes keeping your head about 25 cm’s from his. He will love the start of this special communication between the two of you.",

You've made it through the first week. Well done! Broken sleep and the demands of a newborn can take their toll so be sure to take good care of yourself and to rest as much as possible.

You may find that it will take a little time for all the members of your household from siblings to parents (and even that family pet!) to adjust to your precious newcomer so expect a little disruption at this time and try to let it concern you too much.",

Agatha is becoming more sensitive to his surroundings and may startle with noise or quiet down with stimuli such as music. You may notice that he will begin to stare at soft toys and is fascinated by ceiling lights.
