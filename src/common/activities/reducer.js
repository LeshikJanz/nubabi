    { id: 0, name: 'Jenny Lange', profession: 'Physiotherapist', image_thumbnail: jenny_thumbnail, biography: 'Physiotherapist Jenny Lange has 12 years’ experience working with children with a variety of physical and mental challenges. She is passionate about the foundational role that gross motor development plays for other aspects of a child’s development. After graduating in 2000 with a BSc in Physiotherapy from the University of Cape Town, Jenny joined a private physio practice in Cape Town as a locum where she gained experience working with children. Her interest in paediatrics grew while she worked with spinal cord and traumatic head injury cases. She later joined the Bel Porto School for children with intellectual and physical impairments. After eight years, she moved on to Vista Nova School in Cape Town. Jenny advocates a healthy, active lifestyle with plenty of physical play. “You don’t need expensive toys and a lot of equipment, use what you have at home,” she says. She is very active herself, having completed several Comrades and Two Oceans ultra-marathons, as well as the 80-kilometer ‘Puffer’ trail challenge. Jenny holds advanced qualifications in infant neurodevelopment, and served as the chairperson of the SA Neurodevelopmental Therapy Association for nine years before stepping away this year to focus on her growing family. She welcomed her first baby, Oliver, in August 2013.' },

The momentary balance on each leg individually as he lifts his other leg into the next rung, will help him to gain more control and balance when standing on one leg. The control needed to step between each rung of the ladder and escape out the other side will challenge his balance and the strength of his tummy muscles',
